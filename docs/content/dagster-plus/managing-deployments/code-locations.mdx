# Managing code locations in Dagster+

<Note>This guide is applicable to Dagster+.</Note>

A code location specifies a single Python package or file that defines your Dagster code. When you add a code location in Dagster+, you're instructing your deployment's agent where to find your code. This applies to both Hybrid and Serverless deployments.

Dagster+ agents use this location configuration to load your code and upload metadata about your jobs. Each full deployment - for example, `prod` - can include code from one or more code locations.

By the end of this guide, you'll understand:

- The requirements for Dagster code to work with Dagster+
- How to interact with code locations using the Dagster UI
- How to interact with code locations using the dagster-cloud CLI

## Dagster+ code requirements

<Note>
  <strong>Learn by example?</strong> Check out the{" "}
  <a href="https://github.com/dagster-io/hooli-data-eng-pipelines">
    example repo
  </a>
  , which is set up to run in Dagster+.
</Note>

To work with Dagster+, your Dagster code:

- **Must be loaded from a single entry point, either a Python file or package.** This entry point can load repositories from other files or packages.

- **Must run in an environment where the `dagster` and [`dagster-cloud`](/dagster-plus/managing-deployments/dagster-plus-cli) 0.13.2 or later Python packages are installed.**

- **If using [Hybrid Deployment](/dagster-plus/deployment/hybrid)**:

  - **And you're using an Amazon Elastic Container Service (ECS), Kubernetes, or Docker agent**, your code must be packaged into a Docker image and pushed to a registry your agent can access. Dagster+ doesn't need access to your image - your agent only needs to be able to pull it.

    Additionally, the Dockerfile for your image doesn't need to specify an entry point or command. These will be supplied by the agent when it runs your code using your supplied image.

  - **And you're using a local agent**, your code must be in a Python environment that can be accessed on the same machine as your agent.

Additionally, note that:

- Your code doesn't need to use the same version of Dagster as your agent
- Different code locations can use different versions of Dagster
- Dagster+ doesn't require a [`workspace.yaml` file](/concepts/code-locations/workspace-files). You can still create a `workspace.yaml` file to load your code in an open source Dagster webserver instance, but doing so won't affect how your code is loaded in Dagster+.

## Interacting with code locations

<Note>
  <strong>Editor</strong>, <strong>Admin</strong>, or{" "}
  <strong>Organization Admin</strong> permissions are required to manage code
  locations in Dagster+.
  <br />
  <br />
  If you're an <strong>Editor</strong> or <strong>Admin</strong>, you can only manage
  code locations in deployments where you're an <strong>Editor</strong> or <strong>
    Admin
  </strong>.
</Note>

Interacting with code locations can be done using the Dagster+ UI or the [dagster-cloud CLI](/dagster-plus/managing-deployments/dagster-plus-cli). The CLI commands perform the same underlying operations as those in the **Deployment** tab of the UI.

### Adding code locations

<TabGroup>
<TabItem name="Serverless Dagster+ UI">

For **Serverless deployments**, there are two ways to deploy your code to Dagster+:

- **Start from a template**- Use one of our quickstart templates to get up and running. All templates come with CI/CD already configured and will be cloned to a new git repository.

- **Import an existing project** - Import an existing git repository using our GitHub or GitLab integrations or the [dagster-cloud CLI](/dagster-plus/managing-deployments/dagster-plus-cli). **Note**: If using the GitHub or GitLab integrations, Dagster+ will:

  - Add a [`dagster_cloud.yaml`](/dagster-plus/managing-deployments/dagster-cloud-yaml) to the repository if one doesn't already exist, and
  - Set up [CI/CD](/dagster-plus/references/ci-cd-file-reference)

Select an option in the UI and follow the prompts.

</TabItem>
<TabItem name="Hybrid Dagster+ UI">

1. Sign in to your Dagster+ account.

2. Click **Deployment**.

3. Click **+ Add code location**. This will open a YAML editor with a schema describing the acceptable fields:

   <Image
   alt="Add Code Location Config Editor"
   src="/images/dagster-cloud/developing-testing/code-locations/add_location_ui_config.png"
   width={1118}
   height={511}
   />

4. In the editor, define the code location's configuration. Refer to the [`dagster_cloud.yaml` reference](/dagster-plus/managing-deployments/dagster-cloud-yaml) for information about the properties in the configuration.

   For example, the following config specifies that a code location should include a secret named `my_secret` and run in a k8s namespace (`my_namespace`) whenever the Kubernetes agent creates a pod for the location:

   ```yaml
   location_name: cloud-examples
   image: dagster/dagster-cloud-examples:latest
   code_source:
     package_name: dagster_cloud_examples
   container_context:
     k8s:
       namespace: my_namespace
       env_secrets:
         - my_secret
   ```

5. When finished, click **Add code location**.

The agent will attempt to load your code and send its metadata to Dagster+. **Note**: This may take some time.

Once your code has loaded, the location will show a green **Loaded** status and jobs will appear in Dagster+. If the agent is unable to load your code, the location will show an error with more information.

</TabItem>
<TabItem name="dagster-cloud CLI">

Code locations can be added using the `deployment add-location` command. For example, to add Dagster+'s public example image, run:

```shell
# Set up YAML file for example location
cat > example_location.yaml <<EOL
location_name: cloud-examples
image: dagster/dagster-cloud-examples:latest
code_source:
  package_name: dagster_cloud_examples
EOL

dagster-cloud deployment add-location --from example_location.yaml
```

Values can also be provided using options:

```shell
dagster-cloud deployment add-location test_location \
    --image dagster/dagster-cloud-examples:latest \
    --package-name dagster_cloud_examples
```

To see all available options, run:

```shell
dagster-cloud deployment add-location --help
```

</TabItem>
</TabGroup>

---

### Modifying code locations

<TabGroup>
<TabItem name="Dagster+ UI">

To modify a code location, click the **dropdown menu** to the right of the location. In the menu, click **Modify**:

<Image
alt="Highlighted Modify option in the dropdown menu next to a code location in Dagster+"
src="/images/dagster-cloud/developing-testing/code-locations/modify-code-location.png"
width={1940}
height={480}
/>

After a code location is updated, the agent will perform a rolling update of your code and jobs will update in Dagster+. **Note**: Updating code won't interrupt any currently launched runs.

</TabItem>
<TabItem name="dagster-cloud CLI">

<Note>
  <strong>Heads up!</strong> When using this command, the full set of
  information about the location must be specified even if only one piece of
  configuration is modified.
</Note>

```shell
dagster-cloud deployment update-location [LOCATION_NAME]
```

To see all available options, run:

```shell
dagster-cloud deployment update-location -h
```

</TabItem>
</TabGroup>

---

### Redeploying code locations

To reload your code and upload job metadata to Dagster+ without modifying the code location, click the **Redeploy** button:

<Image
alt="Highlighted Redeploy option in the dropdown menu next to a code location in Dagster+"
src="/images/dagster-cloud/developing-testing/code-locations/redeploy-code-location.png"
width={1920}
height={284}
/>

For example, if the agent was unable to pull your image due to a permissions issue that's since been addressed, clicking **Redeploy** will tell the agent to try again.

---

### Deleting code locations

<TabGroup>
<TabItem name="Dagster+ UI">

To delete a code location, click the **dropdown menu** to the right of the location. In the menu, click **Remove**:

<Image
alt="Highlighted Remove option in the dropdown menu next to a code location in Dagster+"
src="/images/dagster-cloud/developing-testing/code-locations/delete-code-location.png"
width={1940}
height={480}
/>

When prompted, confirm the deletion.

</TabItem>
<TabItem name="dagster-cloud CLI">

```shell
dagster-cloud deployment delete-location [LOCATION_NAME]
```

To see all available options, run:

```shell
dagster-cloud deployment delete-location -h
```

</TabItem>
</TabGroup>

---

### Syncing the workspace with the CLI

The YAML configuration for all code locations in a workspace can be kept in a [`dagster_cloud.yaml`](/dagster-plus/managing-deployments/dagster-cloud-yaml) file and reconciled with the workspace config in Dagster+ using the `deployment sync-locations` command.

For example, if you have the following `dagster_cloud.yaml` file:

```yaml caption=dagster_cloud.yaml
locations:
  - location_name: machine-learning
    image: myregistry/dagster-machine-learning:mytag
    code_source:
      package_name: dagster_cloud_machine_learning
    executable_path: /my/folder/python_executable
    attribute: my_repo
  - location_name: data-eng
    image: myregistry/dagster-data-eng:myothertag
    code_source:
      python_file: repo.py
    working_directory: /my/folder/working_dir/
```

Run the following to reconcile the file with Dagster+'s remote workspace:

```shell
dagster-cloud deployment sync-locations -w dagster_cloud.yaml
```

To see all available options, run:

```shell
dagster-cloud deployment sync-locations -h
```
