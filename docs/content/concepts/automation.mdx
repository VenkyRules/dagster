# Automation

Dagster offers several ways to run data pipelines without manual intervention, including traditional scheduling and event-based triggers. Automating your Dagster pipelines can boost efficiency and ensure that data is produced consistently and reliably.

When one of Dagster's automation methods is triggered, a **tick** is created. A tick is an opportunity for one or more **runs** to be launched. A run will either materialize a selection of assets or execute a job. Some schedules and sensors will launch runs on every tick. Others have associated logic that is executed on each tick which determines the runs to be launched.

In this guide, we'll cover the available automation methods Dagster provides and when to use each one.

## Prerequisites

Before continuing, you should be familiar with:

- [Asset definitions][assets]
- [Jobs][jobs] (_optional_)
- [Ops][ops] (_optional; advanced_)

---

## Available methods

In this section, we'll touch on each of the automation methods currently supported by Dagster. After that we'll discuss what to think about when [selecting a method](#selecting-a-method).

### Schedules

Schedules are Dagster's imperative option for automation. They allow you to specify exactly when a run should be launched, such as Mondays at 9:00 AM. Schedules can target a selection of [assets][assets] or a [job][jobs]. Refer to the [Schedules documentation][schedules] to learn more.

### Sensors

Sensors launch runs in response to a detected event. They periodically check and execute logic to detect an event and conditionally launch runs. They are commonly used for situations where you want to materialize an asset on some externally observable trigger, such as:

- A new file arrives in a specific location, such as Amazon S3
- A webhook notification is received
- An external system frees up a worker slot

You can also use sensors to act on the status of a job run. Refer to the [Sensors documentation][sensors] to learn more.

### Declarative Automation <Experimental />

Declarative Automation allows you to automatically materialize assets when specified criteria are met. Using Declarative Automation, you could update assets:

- When the asset hasn't yet been materialized
- When an asset's upstream dependency has been updated
- After an asset's parents have been updated since a cron tick
- ... based on your own custom conditions

Materialization conditions are declared on an asset-by-asset basis. Refer to the [Declarative Automation documentation][declarative-automation] to learn more.

### Asset Sensors <Experimental />

Asset sensors launch runs when a specified asset is materialized. Using asset sensors, you can instigate runs across jobs and code locations and keep downstream assets up-to-date with ease.

Refer to the [Asset Sensor documentation][asset-sensors] to learn more.

## Selecting a method

Before you dive into automating your pipelines, you should think about:

- Is my pipeline made up of assets, ops, graphs, or some of everything?
- How often does the data need to be refreshed?
- Is the data partitioned, and do old records require updates?
- Should updates occur in batches? Or should updates start when specific events occur?

The following cheatsheet contains high-level details about each of the automation methods we covered, along with when to use each one.
