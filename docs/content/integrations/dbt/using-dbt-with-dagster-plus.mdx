# Using dbt with Dagster+

Using a dbt project in Dagster+ allows you to automatically load your dbt models as Dagster assets. This can be be done with both deployment options in Dagster+: Serverless and Hybrid.

[Learn more about deployment options in Dagster+](/dagster-plus/deployment).

## Serverless deployments

Using Serverless deployment, an existing dbt project can be directly imported in Dagster+ when adding a new code location.

## Hybrid deployments

Using Hybrid deployment, the dbt project must be accessible to the Dagster code executed by your agent:

- Using an Amazon Elastic Container Service (ECS), Kubernetes, or Docker agent, the dbt project must be included in the Docker Image containing your Dagster code.
- Using a local agent, your Dagster code must be able to accessed the dbt project on the same machine as your agent.
